# Pokémon Emerald Legacy-misprit
Changes are based on EL 1.1.4 that was released on 2025.02.27
Here lists my own changes to PEL

Qol changes
- Competitive IVs for Eggs
    - Eggs now have 30 or 31 IVs
    - EL 1.1.4 introduced egg move reminder, with this feature breeding competitive pokemons should be a breeze
    - Technically we could allow 0 speed IVs, but since they are not practical without trick room, lets just stick to U&Vs
- The super annoying low health beeps are removed
- Simplistic battle intro to speed things up
- Use Poké Balls outside of battle to change balls for party pokemon
- Show type effectiveness in battle
- Amulet Coin now works if anyone in party is holding it
- Trainers no longer spin suddenly when you pass them
- Change bag sound to FR style
