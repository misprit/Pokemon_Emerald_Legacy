# Pokémon Emerald Legacy

Emerald Legacy is meant to serve as a finale to the trio of planned projects in the Legacy Trilogy led by [TheSmithPlays](https://www.youtube.com/@smithplayspokemon). It is made using the [Pokémon Emerald Disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) made by the [Pret](https://pret.github.io/) team. This game is focused on refining a game that is considered a classic by many people into a nostalgic but improved experience with 20+ years of hindsight. Emerald is a great game with a ton of flaws when you use that experience to really look at it under a lens. Terrible pokemon pool, Weird team building choices, A great story idea executed poorly, baffling rival decisions, and one of the worst E4s. This game with all of these problems manages to shrug them off with memorable dex additions, fantastic gym leader ace choices, abilities, no more stat xp, Battle frontier, original ideas to the series, and overall a solid game. The Legacy Project aims to take what is good in a game and improve it while bringing its flaws up to that same level. 

Keeping that nostalgic feeling is a key part of the project and thus requires us to temper our changes into things that improve the experience but don’t take you out of that original generation 3 mindset. Things like the Physical/Special Split, adding moves, adding new evolutions, or adding the fairy typing are not things you will find in this game. Instead look for improvements to the Rival storyline, Team Magma & Aqua storyline, Tons of pokemon balancing using the tools given to us in this generation, a robust post game, improved boss fights throughout the game, adjusted level curve, and so much more. We are not trying to create a new game, nor are we trying to create a “Kaizo” game that is insanely difficult. We wanted to create a modern but nostalgic version of Pokémon Emerald. So please enjoy Pokémon Emerald Legacy.
